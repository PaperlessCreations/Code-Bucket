# Warning

Don't use this if you value data haha, I wrote this when I was still new to javascript and securing data. Lots of holes and bugs, and should be only used as a viewpoint of my progression in coding design.


code-bucket

A javascript pastebin leveraging the ace editor.

Still under heavy development. Use at your own risk!!! (No bug support right now, as there are too many to count while developing)

* Oh and at the moment there are lots of security holes as well. To be fixed.
